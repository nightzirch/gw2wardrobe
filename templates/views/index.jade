			h1 Welcome
			p Welcome to Guild Wars 2 Wardrobe! This site is currently under development, therefore you may experience it as laggy, slow, and/or intriguing in ways you cannot fully explain. Text found on this site may not be complete or 100% true, but trust me when I say that you are beautiful no matter what. You are gorgeous, and I like you for visiting this site.
			
			p The site is currently run on a somewhat cheap and slow server somewhere in Amsterdam, Netherlands, so if there are many users online at the same time, something may die. I hope it will not come to that, but it might. By the time the site goes live, I will naturally upgrade the server to a powerhouse of a machine so that everyone can have the same, great experience while window shopping for their ingame wardrobe.
			
			p Guild Wars 2 Wardrobe is utilizing Guild Wars 2's official API v2. The plan is, among other things, to implement OAuth2 so users can login and retrieve all the skins they own directly from Arenanet's servers.
			
			p I hope you have a great stay, and please inform the developer,
